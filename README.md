  How "viper.pl" works.

  Files inlcuded:
   1. viper.pl      - the executable script
   2. urls.txt          - List of url's to check, read by the script.
                          One address per line.http:// is required
   3. smtp_settings.txt - SMTP settings
   4. README.txt        - This file

At the beginning of the script there is a section "Program Seetings", which is the only place 
that you have to change settings.(if you are not familiar in Perl off course).
